# Budget Tracker (PWA)

## Description
Budget Tracker is a progressive web application that allows users to manage their budgets by using the "Add/Subtract Funds" buttons to add costs and deposits to their budget. They can add a transaction whether or not there is a relationship. When a user initiates a transaction while offline, it is saved in the indexedDB and then transmitted to the database when the user reconnects.
